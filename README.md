# Conventions:
Modules that do not require additional resources should have a name ending with _R, indicating that they need to be placed both in the datapacks folder *and* the resourcepacks folder.
Module file names should include only lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes. Only use an underscore when specifying whether it uses custom resources.
